## 🎨 PROTOTYPE STATUS

### ✅ Working Prototype Created!

**Location:** `/prototype/index.html`

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Interactive Sankey diagram
- ✅ 9 major categories visualized
- ✅ Proportional flow widths
- ✅ Hover tooltips
- ✅ Summary statistics
- ✅ Clean modern UI
- ✅ Color-coded categories

**How to View:**
```bash
cd /Users/vidhate/Documents/work/healthcare-spends-claude/prototype
open index.html
```

### Visualization Details:
- **Type:** Sankey flow diagram
- **Perspective:** Category-first (Total → Categories)
- **Tech:** Plotly.js + vanilla JS
- **Data:** Embedded (9 categories)
- **Status:** Proof of concept

---

## 🎯 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Iterate on Prototype (Recommended)
1. **Test the prototype** - Open index.html and evaluate
2. **Gather feedback** - Does Sankey work? What's missing?
3. **Add features** based on feedback:
   - Click-to-isolate flows
   - Payer breakdown view
   - Level 2 drill-down
4. **Then** continue data collection

### Option B: Complete Data Collection First
1. Add remaining 4 Level 1 categories
2. Add Level 2 subcategories
3. Then enhance prototype with full data

### Option C: Parallel Track
1. Enhance prototype interactivity
2. Collect remaining data simultaneously
3. Merge when both ready

**Recommendation:** Option A - validate approach before investing more time

- Updated CONTEXT.md with strategy
- Created DATA-REQUIREMENTS.md

**Session 3 (Oct 24 - Current):**
- Received 9 categories of data (87% coverage!)

---

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### What's Working:
1. **Data structure is solid** - Payer breakdowns sum correctly
2. **Sources well-documented** - Can trace every number
3. **Sankey visualization looks promising** - Good for showing flows
4. **87% coverage is significant** - Enough to validate concept

### What We Learned:
1. **Sankey is intuitive** - Shows money flow naturally
2. **Category-first works** - Logical starting point
3. **Data collection is feasible** - Can get most categories
4. **Prototype validates quickly** - Visual feedback is powerful

### Challenges:
1. **Some categories hard to find** - Payer breakdowns not always published
2. **Administrative categories different** - Not traditional service categories
3. **Missing 13% of spending** - 4 categories still needed for completeness

---

## 📊 DATA QUALITY REPORT

### Source Quality:
- **Tier 1 (Government):** 6 categories ✅
- **Tier 2 (Research orgs):** 3 categories ✅
- **All have valid sources** ✅
- **All have publication dates** ✅
- **All URLs functional** ✅

### Mathematical Validation:
- ✅ Hospital Care: Payers sum correctly
- ✅ Physician Services: Payers sum correctly
- ✅ Prescription Drugs: Payers sum correctly
- ✅ Nursing Care: Payers sum correctly
- ✅ Home Health: Payers sum correctly
- ✅ Dental: Payers sum correctly

**Validation Pass Rate:** 100% for collected data

## 🎨 VISUALIZATION VALIDATION QUESTIONS

### To Test with Prototype:

**Usability:**
- [ ] Can you understand what the diagram shows?
- [ ] Is it clear how money flows?
- [ ] Do the proportions make sense visually?
- [ ] Can you identify the largest spending areas?

**Features:**
- [ ] Is hover information helpful?
- [ ] Do you want to click flows to isolate them?
- [ ] Should we show payer breakdowns?
- [ ] Would drill-down to subcategories be valuable?

**Design:**
- [ ] Is the color scheme effective?
- [ ] Is the layout clear?
- [ ] Are labels readable?
- [ ] Does it look professional?

**Concept:**
- [ ] Is Sankey better than tree/hierarchy view?
- [ ] Does "follow the money" metaphor work?
- [ ] Would you share this with others?
- [ ] Does it help you understand healthcare spending?

## ❓ DECISIONS NEEDED

1. **Does the Sankey visualization work for you?**
   - If yes → Continue with enhancements
   - If no → Consider alternatives

2. **What features are most important?**
   - Click-to-isolate flows?
   - Payer breakdown view?
   - Level 2 subcategories?
   - Multiple perspectives?

3. **Should we complete data first or features first?**
   - Complete remaining 4 categories?
   - Or enhance prototype interactivity?
   - Or both in parallel?

4. **Is desktop-only acceptable for MVP?**
   - Or should we prioritize mobile?
