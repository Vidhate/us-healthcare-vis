  - Checks all required fields
  - Validates source citations
  - Color-coded terminal output

- **Root Node Data** (Level 0)
  - Total NHE: $4.9T validated

  - All sources documented
  - Metadata complete (GDP, population, per capita)

### 2. Documentation
- Execution plan with 7 phases
- README with quick start guide
- Data quality standards defined
- Validation rules documented

### 3. Research Documents Available

## 🚧 NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS

### Step 1: Add Level 1 Categories (Priority)
Need to add 10 major spending categories as children of root:

1. **Hospital Care** - $1,519.7B (31%)
2. **Physician & Clinical Services** - $978.0B (20%)
3. **Prescription Drugs** - $449.7B (9.2%)
4. **Nursing Care Facilities** - $211.3B (4.3%)
5. **Dental Services** - $173.8B (3.5%)
6. **Home Health Care** - $147.8B (3.0%)
7. **Other Professional Services** - $159.9B (3.3%)
8. **Durable Medical Equipment** - $72.8B (1.5%)
9. **Other Non-Durable Products** - $124.1B (2.5%)
10. **Other Health Services** - $270.2B (5.5%)

**For each category, we need:**
- Total spending amount
- Payer breakdown (5 payers)
- CMS sources
- Percentage of parent
- Description

### Step 2: Run Validation
After adding Level 1 categories, validate that:
- All 10 categories sum to $4.9T (±1%)
- Each has complete payer breakdown
- All sources documented

### Step 3: Add Level 2 for Key Categories
Focus on categories with rich data available:
- Physician Services → Primary Care, Specialists, Surgery, Labs
- Hospital Care → Inpatient, Outpatient, ER
- Prescription Drugs → Retail, Mail Order, Specialty

## 📊 DATA GAPS TO FILL

### High Priority (Level 1)
- Need payer breakdowns for 7 categories:
  - Nursing Care Facilities
  - Dental Services
  - Home Health Care
  - Other Professional Services
  - Durable Medical Equipment
  - Other Non-Durable Products
  - Other Health Services

### Medium Priority (Level 2)
- Hospital subcategory breakdowns
- Prescription drug subcategories
- Professional services detail

### Research Sources Needed
- CMS NHE Tables (detailed breakdown)
- KFF Hospital Cost data
- IQVIA Prescription Drug data

---

## 🛠️ TOOLS READY TO USE

### Scripts
- ✅ `npm run validate` - Validates all data
- 🔜 `npm run add-category` - Template for new categories (TODO)
- 🔜 `npm run export-summary` - Generate reports (TODO)

## 💡 RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Next Session:

**Option A: Manual Data Entry (Faster)**
1. Use research docs to manually add Level 1 categories
2. Validate immediately
3. Move to Level 2

**Option B: Build Helper Script First (Better Long-term)**
1. Create `add-category.js` script
2. Use it to add all Level 1 categories
3. Ensures consistency

**Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
1. Add 2-3 Level 1 categories manually
2. Run validation to test
3. Build helper script
4. Use script for remaining categories

### Time Estimates:
- Adding all 10 Level 1 categories manually: ~2-3 hours
- Building add-category script: ~1 hour
- Adding Level 2 subcategories: ~4-6 hours
- Total to 80% data completeness: ~10-15 hours
