## üí° TIPS FOR EFFICIENT DATA COLLECTION

1. **Batch Processing:** Collect all Level 1 payer data in one CMS session
2. **Spreadsheet First:** Use Excel/Google Sheets to organize before JSON
3. **Validate Math:** Check sums immediately to catch errors early
4. **Source URLs:** Copy exact URLs, not just domain names
5. **Screenshot:** Take screenshots of source data tables for backup
6. **Version Control:** Save copies as you make progress
7. **Ask for Help:** If data seems inconsistent, pause and verify

---

## üìû QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE DURING COLLECTION

- [ ] How does CMS categorize hospital-based physician services?
- [ ] Are ambulatory surgical centers in "Hospital" or "Other"?
- [ ] What exactly is in "Other" payer category for each service type?
- [ ] Do retail clinic visits count as Physician Services?
- [ ] Are COVID-related public health expenditures in "Other Health Services"?
