## ‚ùå MISSING CATEGORIES

We're missing 1 category from the original 10:

### Missing: Durable Medical Equipment - $72.8B
**Need:**
- Payer breakdown (5 components)
- Sources

### Missing: Other Professional Services - $159.9B
**Need:**
- Payer breakdown (5 components)
- Sources

### Missing: Other Non-Durable Medical Products - $124.1B
**Need:**

### Missing: Other Health Services - $270.2B  
**Need:**

   - Other Professional Services  
   - Other Non-Durable Products
   - Other Health Services

3. **Rounding Discrepancies** - Minor ($0.1-0.8B)

## üìà PROGRESS UPDATE

### Before This File:
- Completion: 15% (root node only)
- Level 1 categories: 0/10

### After This File:
- **Completion: 60%** üéâ
- **Level 1 service categories: 6/10** (with payer data)
- **Level 1 admin categories: 3/3** (complete)
- **Quality: High** (well-sourced, validated)

---

## üöÄ RECOMMENDATION: YES, BUILD PROTOTYPE!

**Can we build a visualization with this data?** 

### ‚úÖ YES! Here's why:

1. **Enough Data** - 60% complete is plenty for proof-of-concept
2. **Key Categories Covered** - Top 3 spending categories done (Hospital, Physician, Rx)
3. **Flows Work** - Payer breakdowns enable Sankey diagram
4. **Quality Sufficient** - Data validated and sources documented

### üé® Prototype Scope:

**Include in MVP:**
- Hospital Care (largest)
- Physician Services (2nd largest)
- Prescription Drugs (3rd largest)
- Dental (interesting high OOP)
- Nursing Care (shows Medicaid role)
- Home Health (Medicare heavy)

**Exclude from MVP:**
- Missing 4 categories (add later)
- Government Admin (not a flow)
- Public Health (not a flow)
- Insurance Overhead (not a flow)

**Result:** 6-category Sankey showing $3.5T of $4.9T (71% of spending)

### üí° MVP Features:
1. **Main View:** Category-first Sankey (Total ‚Üí 6 categories)
2. **Click Feature:** Isolate flows for any category
3. **Hover:** Tooltips with amounts, %, sources
4. **Simple:** Desktop only, no mobile yet

**Build Time:** 4-6 hours for functional prototype

---

## ‚úÖ NEXT STEPS

### Option A: Build Prototype Now (Recommended)
1. Create simple Sankey with 6 categories
2. Test interactions (click-to-isolate)
3. Validate hypothesis with real visualization
4. Collect feedback
5. Then add missing 4 categories

### Option B: Complete Data First
1. Collect 4 missing categories
2. Then build visualization
3. Launch with 100% data

**Recommendation:** **Option A** - Build now, prove concept, iterate

---

## üìù SUMMARY

**Your data collection is EXCELLENT!** üåü

- ‚úÖ Format perfect
- ‚úÖ Math validates
- ‚úÖ Sources well-documented
- ‚úÖ Enough to build prototype
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 4 categories still needed for full coverage

**READY TO BUILD VISUALIZATION!** üöÄ
