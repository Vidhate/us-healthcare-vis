## What You'll See

### üìä Sankey Flow Diagram
- **Left side:** Total U.S. Healthcare ($4.9T)
- **Right side:** 9 major spending categories
- **Flows:** Lines connecting total to categories (width = spending amount)

### üí∞ Top Statistics
- Total Spending: $4.9T
- Percentage of GDP: 17.6%
- Per Capita: $14,570
- Data Completeness: 87%

### üé® Color-Coded Categories
- **Red:** Hospital Care (31% - largest!)
- **Blue:** Physician Services (20%)
- **Green:** Prescription Drugs (9.2%)
- **Other colors:** Remaining 6 categories

---

## How to Interact

### Hover Over Flows
- Move your mouse over any colored flow
- See popup with:
  - Category name
  - Dollar amount
  - Percentage of total

### Visual Proportions
- **Wider flows** = More spending
- **Narrower flows** = Less spending
- Compare widths to see relative spending

---

## What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Things That Should Work:
1. **Visual clarity** - Can you see 9 distinct flows?
2. **Hover tooltips** - Do they show up with details?
3. **Proportions** - Is Hospital Care visibly largest?
4. **Colors** - Are categories distinguishable?
5. **Layout** - Does it fit on your screen?

### üí≠ Questions to Consider:
1. **Does it make sense?** - Can you understand the flow of money?
2. **Is it useful?** - Does it help you grasp healthcare spending?
3. **What's missing?** - What features do you wish it had?
4. **Would you use it?** - Is this valuable enough to share?

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Can't open file"
**Solution:** Make sure you're in the right directory
```bash
pwd  # Should show: .../healthcare-spends-claude/prototype
ls   # Should show: index.html and README.md
```

### Issue: "Blank page"
**Solution:** Check browser console (right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console)
- If you see errors about Plotly, internet connection might be needed
- Refresh page (Cmd+R)

### Issue: "Flows look weird"
**Solution:** Try a different browser
- Works best in Chrome, Firefox, or Safari
- May have issues in older browsers

### Issue: "Too small to read"
**Solution:** 
- Zoom in (Cmd + Plus)
- Or make browser window bigger
- Designed for desktop (1400px+ width)

## What to Test

### 1. Visual Understanding (2 min)
- [ ] Can you identify the largest spending category?
- [ ] Can you see the relative sizes?
- [ ] Do the flows make intuitive sense?

### 2. Interactivity (2 min)
- [ ] Hover over each flow
- [ ] Read the tooltip information
- [ ] Try hovering over the nodes (left and right sides)

### 3. Design Evaluation (3 min)
- [ ] Is the color scheme pleasant?
- [ ] Is text readable?
- [ ] Does layout feel professional?
- [ ] Any visual confusion?

### 4. Concept Validation (5 min)
- [ ] Does Sankey work better than you imagined?
- [ ] Or worse than expected?
- [ ] What features would make it more useful?
- [ ] Would you want to explore further (drill-down)?

## Feedback Questions

After reviewing, think about:

### Value:
- **Does this help you understand healthcare spending?**
- **Would you share this with colleagues/friends?**
- **Is it better than reading numbers in a table?**

### Features:
- **Do you want to click flows to isolate them?**
- **Should we show payer breakdowns (who pays)?**
- **Would drill-down to subcategories be valuable?**
- **What's the #1 feature you'd add?**

### Design:
- **Is it clear enough?**
- **Too busy or too simple?**
- **Colors good or change them?**
- **Layout improvements?**

### Data:
- **Is 87% coverage enough?**
- **Or should we complete 100% first?**
- **Do you need more detail (Level 2)?**

## Next Steps After Testing

### If You Love It ‚ù§Ô∏è
‚Üí We'll add interactive features:
- Click-to-isolate flows
- Payer breakdown view
- Subcategory drill-down
- Source citations

### If You Like It üëç
‚Üí We'll iterate on design:
- Adjust colors/layout
- Add missing features
- Polish interactions
- Complete remaining data

### If You're Unsure ü§î
‚Üí We'll explore alternatives:
- Try different layouts
- Test other visualization types
- Get more feedback
- Adjust approach

### If It Needs Work üîß
‚Üí We'll redesign:
- Different visualization type?
- Simpler or more complex?
- Different perspective?
- Start over with new concept?

## Pro Tips

1. **Full Screen** - Press F11 for immersive view
2. **Screenshot** - Take a picture to share feedback
3. **Multiple Views** - Open in different browsers to compare
4. **Mobile Test** - Try on phone (works but not optimized)
5. **Compare** - Look at a table of numbers, then look at this

## Technical Notes

**Built with:**
- Plotly.js (Sankey diagram library)
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Embedded data (not loading from JSON yet)

**Limitations:**
- Desktop-optimized (1400px+ best)
- No click interactions yet
- Static data (not from JSON file)
- No drill-down to subcategories

**Next Version Will Add:**
- Load from actual JSON file
- Click-to-isolate feature
- Payer breakdown toggle
- Level 2 subcategories

---

## Share Your Thoughts

After testing, let me know:

1. **Overall impression** (1-10 scale?)
2. **One thing you loved**
3. **One thing that confused you**
4. **One feature you'd add**
5. **Should we proceed with this approach?**

**Enjoy exploring! üéâ**

The visualization represents nearly 5 trillion dollars of healthcare spending - each pixel tells a story about where America's healthcare money goes.
