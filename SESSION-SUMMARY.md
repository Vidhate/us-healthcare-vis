## 🎨 Prototype Details

**Location:** 
```
/Users/vidhate/Documents/work/healthcare-spends-claude/prototype/index.html
```

**To Open:**
```bash
cd /Users/vidhate/Documents/work/healthcare-spends-claude/prototype
open index.html
```

**What It Shows:**
- Sankey flow diagram
- Total → 9 major categories

## 🎯 Your Next Steps

### 1. Test the Prototype (15 min)
- Open `/prototype/index.html`
- Follow TESTING-GUIDE.md
- Answer feedback questions
- Take screenshots if helpful

### 2. Provide Feedback
Consider:
- Does Sankey work for you?
- What features are critical?
- Should we complete data or add features first?
- Any design changes needed?

### 3. Decide Direction
**Option A:** Enhance prototype (add click-to-isolate, etc.)
**Option B:** Complete remaining 4 categories
**Option C:** Do both in parallel

## 🎯 Questions to Answer

After testing prototype:

1. **Does the Sankey visualization work?**
   - Better than expected?
   - Worse than expected?
   - About right?

2. **What features are essential?**
   - Click-to-isolate?
   - Payer breakdown?
   - Drill-down?
   - Something else?

3. **Should we proceed?**
   - Continue with Sankey?
   - Try alternative?
   - Need more iterations?

4. **What's the priority?**
   - Complete data (4 categories)?
   - Add features (interactivity)?
   - Polish design?
   - All of the above?
